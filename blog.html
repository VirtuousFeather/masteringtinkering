				<h5>Mastering Tinkering: Assignment 2, Feb 2, 2024</h5>
</br>				
				<p>A second iteration of my building block can be seen below. The first image shows my initial sketch of specifically the
					four-sided pyramid as a 3d model. The second image shows my 3d printed attempts at the block. The plan
					was to make them able to connect with regular LEGO building blocks, but this requires more finetuning in building block
					printing-size. As further connection pieces to other materials (or more versatility in general), I would also make blocks
					solely consisting of holes on each side and an exact opposite in having only bumps on each side. Depending on the blocks
					I would like to mix my building blocks with, I could also change the shapes and sizes of the building block holes and bumps.
					This requires more time and <i>tinkering</i> though.

						<h5>Mastering Tinkering: Assignment 1, Feb 26, 2024</h5>
		</br>				
						<p>Though a bit vague, for this first assignment we were asked to set-up a portfolio page for this course and an about-me page.
						Furthermore, a picture of our workspace was asked. Boy are you in for a chaotic TM picture, haha. My workspace can be seen below in
						all its messy glory. Below this picture is the same image but with three circled objects that stimulate my tinkering (in green) 
						and a list with three objects that might improve tinkerability. Additionally, we were asked to design our own building block
						and think about some questions and how to answer them. All these points are handled from top to bottom.
						Starting with the circled in green objects:</br></br>
						Number 1 is a 3D printer I sometimes use for small personal projects. Whether it's making props for a play, or wanting the casing for a
						glowing cube making sounds from a videogame, the sky's the limit. Number 2 is a combination of my drawing gear consisting of papers and
						a drawing tablet in case I want the convenience of the oh so important ctrl+Z. This is great for drawing concepts or ideas whenever I feel
						inspired whether it's for the sake of just drawing or for project designs. Number 3 is a combination of my drawers containing most of my
						loose sensors, broken controllers I opened up, and leftover wires and LED-strips. If on a blue monday I would like to make a gadget using sensors
						and pretty lights, I need only reach over from my desk chair and get started. :)
						<img src="amess.jpg" alt="My messy desk" class="centered_image">
						<img src="amessCircles.png" alt="My messy desk with highlighted objects" class="centered_image">
						</br></br>
						Three things that could improve tinkerability include: My not so serious, but still valid answers are coffee, programmer rubber duckies, and
						fidget toys, all three of which can also be found on my desk.</br></br>
						My serious answer would be: 1. Lots of references and atleast a resemblance of a valid and useful plan seeing as tinkering can easily end up in frustration because you easily get lost in excitement,
						distractions and errors you don't know how to fix because the order you're working in is too far from optimal. 2. Starting from an object you already
						have lying around and thinking what other function you would like it to have and go from there to 'improve' it and thus tinker with it. 3.
						Having an organised and open workspace (can't relate) to freely work within. This keeps all things you currently work on close by and in your sight,
						making work more efficient, focused, and in case of electrical work, safe.
						</p></br>
						<p>
						For my building block I chose to make a simple triangle LEGO block in hopes of being able to use it to make easily make teeth for LEGO creatures or pointy
						bits for buildings. The concept sketch can be seen below.
						<img src="Lego.png" alt="A LEGO block design attempt" class="centered_image">
						</p></br>
						
						<p>
						<i>Tinkering is widely associated with 'trial and error'. Where do definitions coincide and where do they differ?</i></br></br>
						</br></br>
						How I see it is that tinkering can involve any material and any tool available, whether it's physical or digital.
						'Trial and error' however seems to have a more specific connotation as in not the combination of multiple disciplines
						like tinkering, but specifically for a programming job, trying out new drawing methods, or trying new materials for making a dress.
						</p>br></br>
						<i>Where would you go hunting for tinkerspiration? List 5 physical and 5 online resources valuable for an I-Tech specialist</i></br></br>
						Physical resources: My own imagination and brainstorming with friends, books, sci-fi movies, previous projects or artworks from museums or on the street, my own
						needs or 'what if I just...' thoughts like upgrading my coffee machine with arms and a track to move my cup of coffee anywhere across the room with a fun sound.
						 Some online resources would be cosplay channels on youtube seeing as they often include electronics in their works, 3d-model websites, Reddit and Discord channels,
						  websites like Artstation or Pinterest, and electronics stores to spark imagination if I see a sensor I haven't seen before (or if it has an alluring price).</br></br>
						<i>List 5 domains, challenges or settings in which you would like to apply tinkering. Can you identify some sweet spots, (perhaps beyond the well-known such as STEM education) and can you also define some limitations? Are there 'untinkerable' domains?</i></br></br>
						Musical installations (as in making music), theater stage props or podium tricks such as moving platforms or walls and light patterns, creating an interactive and immersive museum tour,
						small gadget projects or small electronic companions, and lastly decorating or adding functions to already existing objects/rooms. The major limitation of tinkering
						is that it usually doesn't end in a finished and polished prototype or product, a process with a plan after tinkering is needed.

						<h5>Closing module 1 and (re)viewing video projects, Nov 6, 2020</h5>
		</br>				
						<p>We've reached the end of our first module! To close the module we had to attend an online conference in which the coordinator
						of the first module thanked the teachers and students for doing their best during these pandemic times. Simultaneously in the background
						of the conference, all projects we made in our Visual Communations class were displayed, giving everyone the chance to admire
						their fellow students' works. After the small speech, there was time left for questions. Since I didn't have any, I left 
						the conference early. 
						</p>
						<p>As for video projects of other students, I was surprised to see a lot of groups went for a mystery or action
						movie (our own group included)! I had fun though watching of the projects and seeing how everyone added their own touches to their projects.
						Take for example "Gone by Decision": The fact that they implemented a menuscreen that looks that good and has extra features like credits
						and extras is really deserving of praise! The "Hackers" short film was really reminiscend of the "Unfriended" movies and utilized the
						format (digital font with a black and green color scheme) we associate with hacking really well! Some comments we got on our project include:
						Filmed really well, interesting and exciting, acting in the beginning started off a little rough around the edges, but improved over time,
						nice visual effects/background music. All in all we can say that the projects
						came out really well despite the coronameasures/restrictions.</p>

						<h5>Review a fellow student's blog, Oct 13, 2020</h5>
		</br>				
						<p>I was asked to review the following website: <a href ="https://portfolio.cr.utwente.nl/student/chin-a-kwietl/" target="_blank">https://portfolio.cr.utwente.nl/student/chin-a-kwietl/</a></p>
						
		</br>	
		
						<p>I learned from reviewing this website that only pointing out the mistakes or only praising the website into high heaven
						isn't that helpful. When you review a website you should both point out its strong suits and the lack of whatever <i>should've</i> 
						been there. In case of the latter, providing some advice or alternatives the creator could possibly look into will be both appreciated and helpful
						for future developments of the website in question.
						In the webpage (only one page was used for all mandatory elements) the following stylesheet was used <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/4/w3.css">"https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/4/w3.css"</a>
		</br>				
						Headers, divs and footers were used in an organized matter. Tons of classes (courtesy of the used stylesheet) were used as well as a java script which
						I believe, dictates how the "Read more/less" buttons should behave. Overall, the website looked easy on the eyes and aesthetically pleasing.
						In my review I did point out some things that could use a little more attention to really give the website a personal feel. To name a few
						tips I mentioned in my review: Make the contact e-mail address a little more prominent, so people don't have scroll and really search for
						the contact info, for example, put it on the homescreen so it's instantly visible, use a background image with a decreased opacity to
						give the page a more personalized feel, and last but not least, make the blogposts a little more explicit, write more per blog post.
						All in all, the creator truly made it a good looking and functional website, and let's face it, there is always room for improvement,
						no matter how good a webpage looks!

						<h5>Style sheet personal touches, Sep 28, 2020</h5>
		</br>				
						<p>In the first assignment of WebTech, I already made use of different style sheet elements. What I mean to say is
						that I don't remember all the adjustments I made to parts of an already existent style sheet. There are a few I can
						share though. First up is the navigation bar. I used the CSS code of a youtube tutorial on how to make a nice
						navigation bar. Some changes I made to the navigation bar include: Changing all sidebar wrapper's colors from purple
						hues to blue ones, adjusting the sidebar wrapper's padding per element to match my desired width of the navigation bar
					    and height of some links in the navigation bar, and last but not least, changing the links in the navigation bar
						to meaningful words that represent the rest of my pages (like "home", "portfolio", "about" etc.).</p>
		</br>
						<p>Another note worthy change I made has to do with how my blocks of 'posts' look. As a starting point, I used some
						generic blog post format and edited it in atleast the following places: Everything that had to do with allignment (albeit
						text or images) I changed to align in the center, the background color of the post blocks has been changed from white
						to blue (using the color or background-color function in CSS) and an added value for transparency, the edges of the posts 
						are rounded of since it looks more aesthetically pleasing
						to me, and lastly, the posts now have a white border around them (using the box-shadow function in CSS) to accentuate where 
						the post blocks start and end.</p>

						<h5>Video project Progress, Sep 22, 2020</h5>
		</br>				
						<p>So far, I've had two Discord meetings with my video project group. In the first meeting we brainstormed about the subject
						of the video. Mystery? Thriller? Comedy? Horror? We made a list of 'one sentence' scenarios and later on, each of us voted
						a top three of scenarios that seemed fun to explore further. The scenarios voted by the most people made a second list consisting
						of three scenarios in total to dive into. For the second meeting we had to think about how to three scenarios would play out.
						For each scenario, we made some basic plotpoints, and based on these, we voted which of the three scenarios we would choose
						as our final video subject. We came to an agreement pretty quickly. To briefly summarize our chosen scenario: "The protagonist meets up at a
						childhood friend's house to catch up. During the conversations he/she notices something is off about his/her friend. When asked to get
						a table cloth and some plates, the protagonist comes across a weird looking blueprint. Is there something important the protagonist's
						friend is trying to hide? Deadly consequences might ensue." I realise this summary doesn't tell you that much, but that's the fun
						of mystery, right?</p>

						<h5>Gogbot visit, Sep 21, 2020</h5>
						
		</br>				
						Cluster light & audio show
						<img src="gogbot1.jpg" alt="Cluster" class="centered_image">
						Interactive light artwork
						<img src="gogbot2.jpeg" alt="Light Cube" class="centered_image">
						Bugged Out, raising awareness about reading terms and conditions
						<img src="gogbot3.jpeg" alt="Bugged Out" class="centered_image">
						
						<p>I visited the gogbot festival with a group of friends and acquaintances. The first artwork we came across was
						'Cluster': the light and audio show displayed outside of the train station in Enschede. The combination of the lightshow
						and the used audio manages to bend the audience’s state of mind. From the thrumming bass evoking disorientation and anxiety
						from the audience to the high musical tones and bright white and blue lights eliciting a sense of calmness. 
						This is something I really liked about this piece of art. Furthermore, we continued into the Sickhouse building
						to look at some more artworks, and I can tell you, we weren't disappointed. From the interactive light cube connected to an xbox camera
						that converts your movements into light, to the 'Bugged Out' game that plays into the player's sense of security. 
						It was quite an eventful visit!</p>

						<h5>Possible Portfolio item, Sep 16, 2020</h5>
						
						<img src="portraits_vc.png" alt="The two portraits in question" class="centered_image">

						<p>All right, my first blog post! I consider adding the two images above to my portfolio. The reason for this
						is that the picture on the left is a portrait sketch I drew because I was inspired by a small story I wrote 
						for the Visual Communication classes. The image on the right shows an edited version of the portrait
						that I actually used in my assignment for Visual Communication. What else can I say, I just like how
						the images turned out for my project!</p>

						<h5>Design inspiration, Sep 16, 2020</h5>
						
						<img src="website_design.png" alt="Website design" class="centered_image">

						<p>I opted to go with a simple website design as can be seen in de design above. Since cool colors generally
						give a more relaxed vibe, I went with a blue color palette and a background image that fits the color palette
						and doesn't disturb the aethetic calmness of the website design and layout. 
		</br>
		</br>
						The Navigation bar could use some polishing like the ability to move in and out of the screen, but this will be 
						considered another time. 
		</br>
		</br>
						Apart from the mandatory blog and portfolio pages, I'd also like to add a general homepage with a small introduction.
						An additional 'about' page could be used as a 'meet the creator' page with a general FAQ section if neccessary.
