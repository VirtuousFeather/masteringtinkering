					Hi there, I'll go by the alias 'Feather' on this page!</br></br>
					
					Like the title of this page suggests, I'll be using this webpage</br>
					as a means of virtually displaying things I've made over the course</br>
					of the CreaTe program!</br></br>
					
					To tell you a bit about the owner of this page (A.K.A. me :D):</br>
					I'm originally from the province of Noord-Brabant.</br>
					I like to spend my time being creative, playing videogames with</br>
					both old and new friends and listening to music when I really </br>
					need my me-time.</br>
					As for why I chose to join the CreaTe program, I like to both play around</br>
					with my creativity as well as my technological interests.</br>
					I like to figure out <i>why</i> and (most importantly) <i>how</i> things work</br>
					the way they do.</br></br>
					
					The CreaTe program is only available in Enschede as of now, so I decided</br>
					to move to Enschede and enjoy my time as a student here!</br>
					Even though moving to Enschede and joining the official UTwente Kick-In</br>
					have been quite stressful and chaotic at times, I've had a lot of fun in the last few days!</br>
					From the sports association workshops teaching you how to dance, to row or</br>
					to use self defense to meeting new students from all over the world,</br>
					it's been a fun ride so far!</br></br>
					
					Let's enjoy this year and all years to come!</br>
